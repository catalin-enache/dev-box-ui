minimal imports: import someStuff from node_modules/dev-box-ui/webcomponents/someStuff
distribution import: put distribution in head script then import someStuff from dev-box-ui
normal import: import someStuff from dev-box-ui

maybe we should generate code example tabs dynamically
do we need anymore styles for our React components since we use/wrap web-components which have shadow dom ?
can we define/inject some global/default css vars (like input height) when importing web-components ?
  to avoid distributing adjacent css asset

unittest web-components in iFrame
create event helpers for unittests
in unittests we should test among other things:
  - web component can be dir aware (css in template)
  - css vars are inherited and style can be overridden
  - we have some default css vars injected when using the lib ?
  - web component are not registered multiple times even if using a mix of import styles
  - web component can use external renderers like the col renderer in a table or option renderer in select
