make a properties table
remove duplicated code between iframe and app
maybe we should generate code example tabs dynamically

unittest web-components in iFrame
create event helpers for unittests
in unittests we should test among other things:

  - css vars are inherited and style can be overridden
  - web component are not registered multiple times even if using a mix of import styles
  - web component can use external renderers like the col renderer in a table or option renderer in select
