minimal imports: import someStuff from node_modules/dev-box-ui/webcomponents/someStuff
distribution import: put distribution in head script then import someStuff from dev-box-ui
normal import: import someStuff from dev-box-ui

do we need anymore styles for our React components since we use/wrap web-components which have shadow dom ?

maybe react components should take care of importing by themselves the web component they wrap
in this case we have to solve supporting style override from outside

check box-shadow on rtl

do a copyToClipboard shared utility

on form inputs style the wrapper div not the input itself
extract and reuse the common look & feel for form inputs (use the same vars also)

remove log messages in production (NODE_ENV)

document lack of support for: delegatesFocus: true
make pages for documenting features like Focusable ?

expose utils, decorators, traits and base classes

document how user can extend Base class and apply existing behaviours

unittest web-components in iFrame
create event helpers for unittests
in unittests we should test among other things:
  - web component can be dir aware (css in template)
  - css vars are inherited and style can be overridden
  - we have some default css vars injected when using the lib (like input height)
  - web component are not registered multiple times even if using a mix of import styles
  - web components register their dependencies before they register self
  - web component can use external renderers like the col renderer in a table or option renderer in select
