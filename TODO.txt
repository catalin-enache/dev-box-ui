minimal imports: import someStuff from node_modules/dev-box-ui/webcomponents/someStuff
distribution import: put distribution in head script then import someStuff from dev-box-ui
normal import: import someStuff from dev-box-ui

do we need anymore styles for our React components since we use/wrap web-components which have shadow dom ?
remove style dependencies for react-components build as they are in web-components shadow dom

maybe react components should take care of importing by themselves the web component they wrap
in this case we have to solve supporting style override from outside

check box-shadow on rtl

do a copyToClipboard shared utility

on form inputs style the wrapper div not the input itself
extract and reuse the common look & feel for form inputs (use the same vars also)

remove log messages in production (NODE_ENV)

document lack of support for: delegatesFocus: true
make pages for documenting features like Focusable and how to use css[focusable]?

expose utils, decorators, traits and base classes

make onDBUIWebComponentsDefined an event listener and handler

why classnames does not appear in vendors list ?

rename dist libs with dev-box-ui-react-components-no-deps/with-deps
rename components directory to react-components
rename vendors script to react-vendors

move utils and services into web-components build

document how user can extend Base class and apply existing behaviours
in other words document how user can define its web-components using exposed internals

should we rewrite the main app to not be React based and use React in IFrames ?

unittest web-components in iFrame
create event helpers for unittests
in unittests we should test among other things:
  - web component can be dir aware (css in template)
  - css vars are inherited and style can be overridden
  - we have some default css vars injected when using the lib (like input height)
  - web component are not registered multiple times even if using a mix of import styles
  - web components register their dependencies before they register self
  - web component can use external renderers like the col renderer in a table or option renderer in select
